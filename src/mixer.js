// This function takes an arbitrary number of audio streams and 
// mixes them together into a single output stream.
// The audio streams will be in the form of a list of
// integer shorts to represent 16-bit PCM audio.
// The lists may be of arbitrary length as long as they are
// all the same length as each other.
